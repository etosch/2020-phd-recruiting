Dear $chair,

I hope this message finds you well. New faculty across several institutions are running a virtual PhD recruiting event on Friday, November 6 and were hoping that you could advertise to your students. We are especially intersted in students whose career plans may have changed due to Covid-19, or students who may not have previously considered graduate school.

Please advertise this event as your see fit.
