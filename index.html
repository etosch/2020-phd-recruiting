<h3>What makes this event different?</h3> 
<p>This event was designed with the observation that <i>many students do not consider an advanced degree in computing because they believe academia is not for them</i>. This was an issue before the pandemic and will lead to a disasterous shortcoming of computing professionals in the United States, given volitility in US immigration policy. Our objective is to match junior (i.e., new) faculty members whose recruiting efforts have been hampered by the pandemic with students whose career prospects may have been hampered by the pandemic. 
</p>
<p>
  Through this event we will discuss PhD training as <i>work</i>: we will discuss pay, benefits, and norms. We advocate that students view the PhD as an apprenticeship and highlight the variety of career paths that the PhD opens up. We emphasize that the priority for students and faculty alike will be <i>finding a healthy working relationship</i> between the two parties. Finally, in recognition of the fact that the PhD application process can be daunting, especially when students face inordinate stress and uncertainty, we aim to <i>smooth the path</i> for them.

<a name="logistics"><h1>Logistics</h1></a>

<p>The event will consist primarily of panels and a meet-and-greet with faculty. We will use <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> for chat, and will post <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> links for our interactive discussions.</p>

<h3>Why Discord AND Zoom?</h3> 

<p>Discord allows voice and video chatting, so why also use Zoom? We would like to have the option of recording panels (with participants' permission), and Zoom allows us to do this easily. We would also like to simulate the experience of being in different "spaces" when there are talks/panels/breakout rooms versus casual chat. This means that if you feel overwhelmed or are not interested in a current panel, you can meet other attendees in Discord and have either totally private chat, or in public channels.</p>

<h1>Morning Session Panelists</h1>
<p>The morning session will consist of panels where current faculty answer questions about PhD training.</p>

<a name="recruiting"><h2>Recruiting Faculty</h2></a>
<p>These are junior faculty (i.e., new folks at their universities!) who are looking to hire students in 2021. Pop into a breakout room during the [faculty-student](#matching) session to connect with them as a possible future advisor!</p>

<h1>Afternoon Panelists</h1>
<p>The afternoon sessions will consist of panelists from a variety of career trajectories, at different points in their careers. They range from those who are currently making the decision of whether or not to pursue a PhD, those who had considered a PhD and decided it wasn't for them, those who decided to pursue industrial work with a PhD, and more!</p>

<a name="current-students"><h2>Current Students</h2></a>
<p>Come chat with current students during one of <a href="#current-students-sessions">breakout sessions</a> and hear about their paths to and from research in computing. Have a candid discussion about the ups and downs of graduate school, what to look for in an advisor, and when to walk away. </p>

<a name="non-academic-panelists"><h2>Possible Paths</h2></a>

<p>In parallel with our <a href="current-students">student panelists</a>, there will also be panelists who have had prior research experience in computing, but have chosen to go into industry, and panelists who have earned a PhD, and have chosen to follow a non-academic path. The former can provide a perspective on why graduate school might not be the right path. The latter can provide a perspective on the opportunities that a PhD in computing can open, that are not within academia.</p>

<a href="graduated-cs-students"><h3>What if I decide a PhD isn't for me?</h3></a>
Come chat with folks who had some computing research experience, either as undergraduates or Master's students, and decided that the PhD wasn't for them, for now.
