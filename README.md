## Welcome to our 2020 PhD Recruiting Event Webpage!

This event will take place on *Friday, November 6*. We are currently looking for faculty participants. If you are:

1. A US-based academic looking to hire PhD students during the 2021 calendar year, and 
2. Interested in matching with students who might otherwise have chosen industry, and 
3. Excited to participate in a recruiting event that broadens participation in academic computer science, then...

Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/txQ2dp1dgbhMaqJT7) to indicate your availability.

### What makes this event different?

This event was designed with the observation that _many students do not consider an advanced degree in computing because they believe academia is not for them_. This was an issue before the pandemic and will lead to a disasterous shortcoming of computing professionals in the United States, given volitility in US immigration policy. Our objective is to match junior (i.e., new) faculty members whose recruiting efforts have been hampered by the pandemic with students whose career prospects may have been hampered by the pandemic. 

Through this event we will discuss PhD training as _work_: we will discuss pay, benefits, and norms. We advocate that students view the PhD as an apprenticeship and highlight the variety of career paths that the PhD opens up. We emphasize that the priority for students and faculty alike will be _finding a productive and healthy working relationship_ between the two parties. Finally, in recognition of the fact that the PhD application process can be daunting, especially when students face inordinate stress and uncertainty, we aim to _smooth the path_ for them.

|-------------|----|
| 09:00-09:15 | Welcome + Introduction to Tooling |
|             | _This will be a pre-recorded message explaining Zoom and Discord_ |
|             | * _Have everyone log into Discord_  |
|             | * _Have everyone log into Zoom to say "hi"_  |
|             | * _Community troubleshooting_ |
| 09:15-09:40 | Why Graduate School, Why Now? |
|             | [Brittany Johnson](https://cs.gmu.edu/~johnsonb/) & [Emma Tosch](https://uvm.edu/~etosch) |
|             | _This session will discuss why graduate school can be a good option_, particularly right now. |
|             | _Some major points of discussion:_ |
|             | * _Graduate school can be a safety net during economic contraction_ |
|             | * _Address why stay in academia when there is important work in e.g. activism that students may be compelled to do right now_ |
| 09:40-10:00 | Break |
|             | _Check into affinity group channels, meet some new folks!_ |
| 10:00-10:25 | Graduate School is a Job | 
|             | * _Discussion of Pay_ |
|             | * _Discussion of TA vs RA vs fellowships_ |
|             | * _Explain the PI’s perspective and how understanding this is helpful_ |
| 10:30-10:55 | Graduate School is not a Job |
|             | * _Discussion of what the PhD actually is_ |
|             | * _Must work in an area where you can receive guidance/mentorship_ |
|             | * _How it is more like an apprenticeship_ | 
|             | * _Developing mastery of a topic, building skills along the way_ |
| 11:00-11:20 | Break |
|             | _Give students the chance to connect with faculty_ |
| 11:20-11:45 | Working toward mastery: technical skills |
|             | _Emphasis should be on the idea that these four are skills everyone must have in some capacity to make progress and get a PhD. The farther along you are when you start, the easier some things will be. No one will be excellent at all four, and everyone should work on these skills every day: |
|             | * Programming/Coding |
|             | * Reading papers (and doing so quickly!) |
|             | * Math/formalization |
|             | * Writing|
|             | * Experiment design + human subjects (pivot)_ |
| 11:50-12:15 | Working toward mastery: research skills |
|             | _Emphasis should be on the idea that this is what your advisor is actually teaching you; if you learn basic technical skills from them, that’s a bonus, but their job is to actually teach you about the business of doing research and/or working in academia: |
|             | * Identifying interesting research questions |
|             | * Forming hypotheses |
|             | * Designing formalisms and/or experiments to evaluate those questions |
|             | * Evaluating your own work |
|             | * Navigating related work |
|             | * Critiquing others’ work_ |
| 12:20-13:40 | Lunch break/power naps |
| 13:40-15:00 | Faculty-student breakout rooms |
|             | _Each faculty member who is recruiting students will host a breakout room. We encourage faculty to provide <2min video summaries of their research, to be advertised ahead of the event_ |
| 15:05-16:25 | Concurrent non-faculty breakout rooms | 
|             | _Three breakout rooms featuring: |
|             | * Current students (preferably a college senior, a first-year graduate student, and a second-year graduate student) talk about about their experiences regarding graduate school.  |
|             | * Graduated CS students who perhaps did REUs or had some research experience and decided NOT to go to graduate school 
|             | * Graduated PhDs who are not in academic positions, to talk about non-faculty paths that the PhD opens up_
| 16:30-16:40 | Closing remarks |
|             | * _How to follow up_ | 
|             | * _Keep in touch_ |
|             | * _We will send reminder emails that you can opt-out of_ |


## Logistics

The event will consist primarily of panels and a meet-and-greet with faculty. We will use [Discord](https://discord.com/) for chat, and will post [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) links for our interactive discussions. 

### Why Discord AND Zoom?

Discord allows voice and video chatting, so why also use Zoom? We would like to have the option of recording panels (with participants' permission), and Zoom allows us to do this easily. We would also like to simulate the experience of being in different "spaces" when there are talks/panels/breakout rooms versus casual chat. This means that if you feel overwhelmed or are not interested in a current panel, you can meet other attendees in Discord and have either totally private, or
