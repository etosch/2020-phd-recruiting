1. A US-based academic looking to hire PhD students during the 2021 calendar year, and 
2. Interested in matching with students who might otherwise have chosen industry, and 
3. Excited to participate in a recruiting event that broadens participation in academic computer science, then...

### What makes this event different?

This event was designed with the observation that _many students do not consider an advanced degree in computing because they believe academia is not for them_. This was an issue before the pandemic and will lead to a disasterous shortcoming of computing professionals in the United States, given volitility in US immigration policy. Our objective is to match junior (i.e., new) faculty members whose recruiting efforts have been hampered by the pandemic with students whose career prospects may have been hampered by the pandemic. 

Through this event we will discuss PhD training as _work_: we will discuss pay, benefits, and norms. We advocate that students view the PhD as an apprenticeship and highlight the variety of career paths that the PhD opens up. We emphasize that the priority for students and faculty alike will be _finding a productive and healthy working relationship_ between the two parties. Finally, in recognition of the fact that the PhD application process can be daunting, especially when students face inordinate stress and uncertainty, we aim to _smooth the path_ for them.

## Logistics

The event will consist primarily of panels and a meet-and-greet with faculty. We will use [Discord](https://discord.com/) for chat, and will post [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) links for our interactive discussions. 

### Why Discord AND Zoom?

Discord allows voice and video chatting, so why also use Zoom? We would like to have the option of recording panels (with participants' permission), and Zoom allows us to do this easily. We would also like to simulate the experience of being in different "spaces" when there are talks/panels/breakout rooms versus casual chat. This means that if you feel overwhelmed or are not interested in a current panel, you can meet other attendees in Discord and have either totally private chat, or in public channels.
